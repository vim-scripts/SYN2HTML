Yet Another Version of the 2html.vim script found in the $VIMRUNTIME/syntax directory.

This version is written in python, making it far easier to do things like change the format of HTML created by the script (i.e. putting it in <div> tags instead of <html> tags).

To use this script, your vim must be compiled with +python.
